# juke-x1
Linux-based cmus jukebox built into a kiosk with arduino keypad controls

Juke-X1 is a linux machine running cmus with custom
key bindings. The keypad is controlled by an Arduino
microprocessor. The system can be built into a kiosk.

The jukebox main functions are:
- listen to your library in shuffle/non-shuffle mode
(best if your library files are properly tagged).

- add music to a queue and listen to it like a regular jukebox.
